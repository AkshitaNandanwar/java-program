Question 1:
Write a program that takes as input a sorted array of numbers. The objective is to return the array arranged in an
alternate order such that max value is followed by min value in a descending fashion, so that the 1st element is the
max value, 2nd element is the min value, 3rd element is the second max value, 4th element is the second min value &
so on.
Example: For an input array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
the expected result would be [10, 2, 8, 4, 6]

Solution:

let arr =  [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]; // given array in question
let n = arr.length; // length of an main array 
let output =""; // create empty string variable for print o/p in row
rearrange(arr,n); //call a function
console.log("Output ");
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
        //onsole.log(arr[i] + " ");
        output = output + arr[i] + " ";
        console.log(output );

function rearrange(arr, n){
    let temp = new Array(n); //DECLARE Array  store or to hold modified array
    let small =0, large = n-1;  // Indexes of smallest and largest elements from remaining array.
    
    let CheckLargeORSmallNp = true;   // To indicate whether we need to copy remaining  largest or remaining smallest at next position
   
     // Store result in temp[]
    for(let i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(CheckLargeORSmallNp){
            temp[i] = arr[large--];
        }else{
            temp[i] =arr[small++];
        }

        CheckLargeORSmallNp =!CheckLargeORSmallNp;

    }
 // Copy temp[] to arr[]
    for(let i=0;i<n;i++){
        arr[i] =temp[i];
    }

    
}

Time Complexity: O(N), Iterating over the array of size N 2 times.
Space complexity : O(N)
